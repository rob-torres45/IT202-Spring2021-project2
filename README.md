# IT202-Spring2021-project2

For this project, I demonstrate an understanding of drawing and animation using the HTML5 canvas element as well as an understanding of JavaScript basics. I made a simple scrolling game using the HTML canvas element and the requestAnimationFrame method of the window object.
In the game, my player character is on the left edge of the screen and moves parallel to that edge when the player presses the relevant arrow keys. Two types of objects will scroll across the screen toward the player. If the player comes into contact with a harm object, the number of lives remaining is reduced. If the player comes into contact with a benefit object, the points are increased.
